# My Data Science Portfolio
I am a student at George Mason University with a passion for all things data science. Currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computational and Data Science with a minor in Biology, my domain interests extend outside the classroom to projects with applications in machine learning, agent-based modeling, and data analysis.

### Cancer Classification Model
Data analysis and feature engineering are performed on a cancer classification dataset for use with sequential neural network to classify observations as benign or malignant.

*Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, tensorflow, seaborn, numpy*

### Chicago Crime Prediction by Venue Clusters
Chicago crimes and census data are joined with venue information obtained with Foursquare Places API. The resulting dataset is used to train a K-Means Clustering algorithm to create clusters based on the frequency of venue types in a certain location. The clusters are evaluated to determine which combinations of venues have the highest probability of criminal incidents occuring.

*Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, folium*

### Dating App Simulation
Two agent based models are created to simulate agent interactions in dating applications. Each application was created with its own level of multiplicity. The goal of this experiment was to observe agent interactions under differing rulesets. This project was submitted to the SpringSim 2020 Conference and is currently under review for publication in a scientific journal.

*Libraries: networkx, numpy, time, random, scipy*

### Housing Price Forecaster
A UiPath automoation sequence allows the user to input attributes of their desired home. A sequential neural network is then trained with a house listing dataset, and returns a predicted price based on the inputs given.
